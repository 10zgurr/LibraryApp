# LibraryApp

I have created a sample Android library application that has a local database you can insert, update, delete, and get all books. I have used Kotlin Coroutines library for all these database query processes'. Because for the best performance you don't want to make database queries in the main thread. You must make them at the background thread and Kotlin Coroutines library gives you a good performance and reliability.
The project built on MVVM architecture and it uses Android Jetpack components and Kotlin language features.
You can learn from this project how to create Room Database and make queries with it. Also, understanding MVVM architecture and Kotlin language.
Besides, you can take a look at DiffUtil class which for updating your adapter classes.

The list of features that I have used in my project:

- Android Jetpack
- Kotlin language
- Kotlin Coroutines
- MVVM Architecture
- Room Persistence Library
- DiffUtil
