# LibraryApp

I have created a sample Android library application that has a local database that you can insert, update, delete and get all books.
Also, the project built on MVVM architecture and it uses Android Jetpack components and Kotlin language features.
You can learn from this project how to create Room Database and use it. Also, understanding MVVM architecture and Kotlin language.
Besides, you can take a look at DiffUtil class which for updating your adapter classes.

The list of features that I have used in my project:

- Android Jetpack
- Kotlin language
- MVVM Architecture
- Room Persistence Library
- DiffUtil Callback
